# DEPRECATION NOTICE

AeroGear Security was born 2 years ago, by that time frameworks didn't have anything for mobile on the server side. Thus, we added few classes to support the bare minimum.

Today, we have more alternatives, like [Keycloak](http://www.jboss.org/keycloak) or [Picketlink](http://www.picketlink.org). If somehow this change will affect you, feel free to contact us at [aerogear-dev](http://aerogear-dev.1069024.n5.nabble.com).
